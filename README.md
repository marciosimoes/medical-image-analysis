## Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis

During my degree course I had the opportunity to work and better understand the area of Image Processing through a project I carried out with the Lecturer at Institute of Mathematics UNICAMP, whose your Research was in the area of Medical Image Analysis and which helped me to get a little deeper into this area.

Through this project I was able to understand mathematically and through Python applications the basic principles of a Neural Network until its use in Deep Learning, exploring tools such as PyTorch and techniques as Transfer Learning.

In the first part of the project, I had my first contact with neural networks and I built my first neural network for Handwritten Digit Recognition, applied a Convulational Neural Network and applied the Transfer Learning technique through PyTorch.

And not least important, the application of all the tools studied for the Classification of Medical Images, which consist of images of mandibular cysts exams, where the classification by extraction of descriptors was also explored, which brought better results:

In the second part, a weighted ensemble application was carried out, through which there was a new improvement in the results:
